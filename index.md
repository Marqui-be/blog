# The engineering behind Marqui.
_These are our internal notes.

This site shows how Marqui really works.

Not the offers.
Not the cases.
Not the sales story.

This is the lab.

Here we write down how we turn normal businesses
into machines that make profit with less effort.

Most of this work is public.
Some of it becomes products.
Some of it becomes investments.

All of it starts here.

## What you are looking at

Q’s Logs is a collection of behind-the-scenes notes.

They show how we think about:
- profit
- systems
- automation
- decisions
- scale

These are not polished articles.
They are working notes.

The kind of notes you normally never get to see.

## Why we share this

Most companies waste a lot of energy.

Not because people are lazy.
But because the system is bad.

Too many steps.
Too many decisions.
Too much work that does not move profit.

At Marqui, we don’t fix this with advice.
We fix it with design.

We build systems that do the work instead of people.

This site exists to show how that is done.

Openly.

---

## What Marqui actually does

Marqui uses these systems to:
- invest in companies
- rebuild how they work
- and turn them into profit engines

That is our front office.

But most of the real work happens before that.
In thinking.
In testing.
In writing things down.
In killing bad ideas early.

That work lives here.

Free to read.
Free to use.
Free to learn from.

## Who this is for

This is for people who look at a business and think:

“Why is this so heavy?”
“Why does everything need so much effort?”
“There must be a smarter way.”

Founders.
Managers.
Operators.
Executives.
Anyone who cares about leverage.

If you like simple systems that replace hard work,
you are in the right place.

---

## How we work

We always do the same thing.

We decide what the business should look like
when it works perfectly.

Then we work backwards.

Every step that creates friction gets removed.
Every task that can be automated gets automated.
Every decision that repeats gets turned into a rule.

No motivation.
No hustle.
Just design.

<span class="callout-label">2026 Experiment</span>

In 2026, we take this to the extreme.

We run a real company using AI systems.
Not as a demo.
Not as content.

But to answer one simple question:

**How much human work does a company really need?**

Everything is documented here.

## How to read this site

There is no order.
There is no feed.

Each note stands on its own.

Read one.
Skip ten.
Come back later.

Over time, the picture becomes clear.
