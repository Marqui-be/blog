# Q’s Logs

Q’s Logs is a public place where I think in the open.

Here, I write about how companies can be built in a calmer, more structured way.
Not with motivation or hype, but with systems that actually hold up over time.

This is not a blog with tips.
It is not a course.
And it is not content written to perform.

It is a working log of how decisions are made, tested, and sometimes changed.

## Why this exists

Most founders don’t fail because they lack ideas.
They fail because everything becomes heavy as the company grows.

More meetings.
More pressure.
More effort.
But not much more return.

I’ve lived that problem myself.

These logs exist to explore another path:
building companies the way engineers build systems.

Start from the end goal.
Work backwards.
Remove weak points one by one.
Design businesses that can run without constant heroics.

What you’ll find here is not opinion.
It is thinking in motion.

Some notes are rough.
Some are revised.
All are written from real use.

## Who is Q?

I’m Q, founder of Marqui.

For many years, I worked in high-stakes R&D environments,
where mistakes were expensive and systems had to work under pressure.

At the same time, I built and sold my own digital products and companies.

Some did well.
Some didn’t.
More than once, I left value on the table at exit.

Not because the ideas were wrong,
but because the systems behind them were fragile.

This site is where I document what I learned,
and how I now approach business with more clarity and less chaos.

<span class="callout-label">2026 Public Experiment</span>

In 2026, part of this work is applied to a live experiment:
running a real company using AI-driven decision systems.

The goal is not to remove people,
but to understand where human judgment is needed —
and where it can safely step back.

Everything is documented as engineering logs.

## How to read this site

Each note focuses on one idea, question, or system.

You don’t need to read things in order.
There is no feed.
No algorithm.
No “latest post” pressure.

You can start anywhere.
Follow what feels relevant.
Come back later.

Over time, the notes connect into a larger picture.
