## Q’s Logs

Q’s Logs is a public engineering log.

It documents how businesses, decision systems, and automation are designed
when the goal is not growth for growth’s sake,
but leverage, clarity, and durability.

This is not a blog.
It is not a course.
It is not a marketing channel.

It is a place where systems are made observable.

## Who is Q?

Q is the founder of Marqui.

For over fifteen years, Q worked in R&D on high-stakes, classified systems.
In parallel, he built and sold digital products and companies of his own.

Some worked.
Some didn’t.
Several exits left significant value on the table.

Not because the ideas were weak,
but because the systems behind them were fragile.

These logs are written from that tension:
engineering discipline applied to entrepreneurial reality.

## Why these logs exist

Most founders work harder as companies grow.
Effort increases.
Return does not.

Q’s Logs exist to explore a different approach:

- start from the end goal
- work backwards
- remove failure points systematically
- design businesses that run without constant heroics

What you’ll find here are not opinions,
but evolving models, constraints, and decisions.

Some are unfinished.
Some are revised.
All are grounded in real use.

<span class="callout-label">2026 Public Experiment</span>

In 2026, part of this work is applied to a live experiment:
operating a real company using AI-driven decision systems.

The goal is not automation for its own sake,
but to test where human judgment can be removed,
constrained, or delayed without breaking the business.
