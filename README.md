# Q’s Logs

This repository contains public engineering notes by Q.

These notes document how systems for profit, decision-making, and automation
are designed. Not as tutorials, but as observable reasoning.

They reflect how problems are framed, how decisions are structured,
and how systems evolve under real constraints.
