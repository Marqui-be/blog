## This is not about replacing humans

This experiment is often misunderstood.

It is not about taking people out of the loop.
It is about taking chaos out of the system.

Most business failures are not caused by bad intentions or low effort.
They are caused by normal human limits.

People get tired.
People leave.
People make inconsistent decisions.
Context gets lost.
Standards slowly decay.

In small and mid-sized companies, this compounds fast.

## The real problem we keep seeing

As an investor in SME companies, one issue keeps repeating.

Finding the right CEO for the size of the company is extremely hard.

Either:
- the CEO is over-qualified, too expensive, and mismatched to the stage  
or
- the CEO has energy and drive, but lacks experience and pattern recognition

Both cases create risk.

Not because people are bad.
But because the business depends too much on individuals.

So the question becomes:

**What should a CEO really do, and what should the company do by itself?**

## The CEO role, reduced to essentials

A CEO should focus on the work that truly makes a difference:

- setting direction
- building trust
- hiring and keeping the right people
- creating alignment
- making judgment calls where context and taste matter

What a CEO should not have to carry is:

- every process detail
- every checklist
- every control loop
- every reminder
- every report interpretation

That part should be engineered into the business.

If leadership quality drops slightly, the company should not fall apart.

## AI as guardrails, not autonomy

This is where AI becomes interesting.

Not as a replacement for leadership.
But as guardrails for it.

Think of it like a technical system.
You do not rely on perfect operators.
You design the system so failure is hard.

AI can:
- enforce standards
- check consistency
- surface deviations early
- execute repeatable work
- reduce decision load

The human stays in control.
The system reduces the damage of normal human variation.

That is the bet.

## Why most AI-in-business experiments fail

Most attempts fail for one reason: **drift**.

Small changes in inputs cause large changes in outputs.

- a prompt changes slightly
- context is missing one day
- extra information appears the next
- the model behaves differently under the hood

For creative work, this is fine.

For business operations, it is unacceptable.

In business, the rule is simple:
**the same input should produce the same output.**

Most agent-based setups today cannot guarantee that.
So trusting them with a real company would be irresponsible.

Unless the approach changes.

## The top-down approach

Most AI adoption is bottom-up.

- automate emails
- generate content
- answer support tickets
- build small tools

Useful, but limited.

We take a top-down approach.

That means:
- define what the business is
- define how it should behave
- define standards and targets
- define decision rules
- define escalation paths
- define feedback loops

Only then do we let AI operate inside those boundaries.

Not via chat.
Not via free-running agents.

Through controlled software systems.

## The system we use

This experiment combines three components.

### Big BOB

A collection of proven consulting knowledge.
Boring. Old. Effective.

The kind of knowledge that turns chaos into predictable performance.

### BASE100

A standard model to describe any business in a consistent way.

Most companies cannot clearly describe themselves as a system.
That makes automation fragile.

BASE100 becomes the shared language between humans, software, and AI.

### BOSS

The implementation roadmap.

This is not a switch you flip.
It is a sequence.

BOSS defines how a real, messy company is converted step by step into an AI-supported operation, without breaking it.

## What Marqui actually does

This is exactly how we work at Marqui.

We step into companies and apply this system to:

- professionalize operations
- reduce decision load
- remove bottlenecks
- improve margins
- stabilize execution
- prepare the business for exit

The result is not a flashy AI demo.

The result is a company that is harder to mess up.

## The 2026 experiment

In 2026, this system will be tested on a real business.

Not a simulation.
Not a sandbox.

A small company.
Near break-even.
Full of complexity.
Real staff.
Real customers.
Real consequences.

I am committing up to **€1,000,000** to this experiment.

Because opinions do not matter.
Results do.

## Why follow this series

This is not a motivational blog.
It is not a marketing channel.

It is a public engineering log.

You will see:
- what we design
- what breaks
- what works
- what does not
- how complexity is reduced
- how systems replace heroics

If you run a business, this shows what professionalization looks like in practice.
If you operate inside one, it shows how structure beats effort.
If you invest, it shows what makes companies durable and sellable.

No hype.
No shortcuts.
No magic.

Just systems.

## One sentence to remember

**The future is not AI replacing leaders.  
It is leaders supported by systems that make businesses reliable.**
